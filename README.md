## Usage

Make sure AWS credentials are set as environment variables or are available otherwise to `boto3` library
which this program uses to connect to AWS API.

The AWS Price List Query API is [not available in all regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/using-price-list-query-api.html#price-list-query-api-endpoints); this program defaults to using the API endpoint in `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), and permits changing regions to the other available endpoints (`eu-central-1`, Frankfurt; `ap-south-1`, Mumbai) using the `--region` option.

```shell
Usage: ec2pricing [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  -r, --region [us-east-1|eu-central-1|ap-south-1]
             The AWS region to use. Limited to specific
             regions where the Pricing API is available;
             default: us-east-1  
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build     Build SQLite database with prices from given JSON
  download  Download EC2 prices to JSON file
```

<a id="download"></a>
Download all "On Demand" prices for all regions for "Shared" instances into a JSON file.


```shell
ec2pricing download
```

<a id="build"></a>
Build a SQLite database from that JSON file.

*You can see an example of built database in `examples/prices.db` file in this repo.*

```shell
ec2pricing build
```

<a id="working"></a>

The resulting file is a SQLite database with a single `prices` table in it.

<a id="table"></a>
Resulting table `prices` in the `prices.db` file has following columns:

<table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
    <tr><td><b>family</b></td><td>Instace family</td><td>General purpose, Compute optimized</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>type</b></td><td>Instace type group</td><td>a1, t3a, c5</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>size</b></td><td>Instace size</td><td>nano, micro, xlarge, 32xlarge</td></tr>
    <tr><td>burst</td><td>Is instance burstable?</td><td>Yes, No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>base</td><td>Baseline performance of CPU (%)</td><td>5, 10, 100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>processor</td><td>Name of the physical CPU</td><td>AWS Graviton, AMD EPYC</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bit</td><td>CPU bitness</td><td>32-bit, 64-bit</td></tr>

    <tr><td>tenancy</td><td>Instance tenancy</td><td>Shared, Dedicated, Host</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>region</b></td><td>AWS Region</td><td>US East (Ohio), EU (Ireland)</td></tr>

    <tr><td>speed</td><td>Declared CPU clock speed</td><td>2.5 GHz, Up to 3.2 Ghz. 0 GHz</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>actual</b></td><td>Actual CPU clock speed multiplied by baseline</td><td>0.125 GHz, 2.5 Ghz</td></tr>
    <tr><td>network</td><td>Network performance</td><td>Up to 3500 MiB</td></tr>
    <tr><td>gen</td><td>Is it current generation of instances?</td><td>Yes, No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>cur</td><td>Price currency</td><td>USD, CNY</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>hourly</b></td><td>Hourly price</td><td>0.0255</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>montly</b></td><td>Monthly price (hourly * 24 * 30)</td><td>3.844</td></tr>

</table>

<a id="queries"></a>
The built database can be opened in any SQL IDE, for example, DBeaver (open source SQL editor) or in any other way.
You can then run queries in it.

**Show cheapest x86-64 virtual machines**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prices WHERE arch = 'x86'
 ORDER BY monthly;
```

**Show cheapest ARM machines in Ireland**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prices
 WHERE arch = 'arm' AND region = "EU (Ireland)"
 ORDER BY monthly;
```

**Sort all machines alpabetically by their family, type and power**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prices
 ORDER BY family, type, norm;
```

<a id="limitations"></a>

## Limitations

Currently, downloaded prices are limited to instances with:

* "Shared" tenancy
* "Linux" operating system
* Support for VPC networking
* Only "On Demand" pricing, no reserved instances or saving plans
* "Used" capacity reservation

All these are default settings for EC2 instances when you check prices for them on AWS pricng website.
